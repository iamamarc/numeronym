# NUMERONYM


A numeronym is a number-based word.

Most commonly, a numeronym is a word where a number is used to form an abbreviation (albeit not an acronym or an initialism). Common examples of this format are I18n for Internationalization and L10n for Localization

<first letter><length of word - 2><last letter>

If two words have the same length, same first letter and same last letter, they will have the same numeronym. Write a function that given a list of words, returns a list of unique numeronyms.

If a collision is detected, a unique numeronym can be generated by decrementing the number and using an extra letter either on the left side, or right side.

Example:

"institutionalization", "intercrystallization", "interdifferentiation", "internationalization" could all have i18n as their numeronym.

The first word can used i18n, but the second one cannot, so it needs to either use in17n or i17on (or any other available longer numeronym), the next one will need to use int16n or i16ion, etc.

example output:

institutionalization => i18n 
intercrystallization => in17n
interdifferentiation => int16n
internationalization => inte15n
